- **WebSocket Server**: Real-time communication layer for frontend integration
- **Observability Stack**: Complete telemetry, metrics, logging, and health monitoring system
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-based config system with validation
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Improved resilience and fault tolerance

**🏢 Core Elevator Logic**
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Better separation with domain objects, error handling, and state management
- **Enhanced Testing**: Extensive behavior tests, acceptance tests, and benchmarks
- **Improved Algorithms**: Better elevator scheduling and direction handling

**🐳 DevOps & Documentation**
- **Docker Compose**: Multi-service orchestration with observability stack
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: API specs (OpenAPI), architecture guides, and testing strategies
- **Build System**: Makefile with development, testing, and deployment targets

**📊 Key Metrics:**
- 1,820+ lines of new elevator tests
- 900+ lines of observability client tests
